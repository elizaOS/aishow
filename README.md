## Framework 
- The 3D visualization framework uses **Unity** for rendering.
- Sithlords AI showrunner framework runs on **client-side JavaScript** in a web browser. https://hackmd.io/@smsithlord/Hk7NOUrmke
  - It sends **async calls** to handle:
    - **Scene loading:** Includes location, list of actors, and named spawn points.
      - The stage responds with a `loadSceneComplete` event once finished.
    - **Dialogue lines:** Specifies the actor speaking and their line.
      - A TTS system speaks the line and fires a `speakComplete` event after finishing.
      -  **ElevenLabs** for voices
     
## Implementation

Currently the project polls the client side js app that is serving an event stream to a json endpoint. As we poll this endpoint, there are events that come down the line, such as the example below in the `EventProcessor.cs`

```c#
public void ProcessEvent(EventData eventData)
    {
        switch (eventData.type)
        {
            case "episodeGenerated":
            Debug.Log("Episode generated event received, waiting to prepare scene...");
            StartCoroutine(HandleEpisodeAndPrepareScene(eventData));
            HandlePrepareScene(eventData);
            break;

            case "prepareScene":
                HandlePrepareScene(eventData);
                break;

            case "speak":
                HandleSpeak(eventData);
                break;

            default:
                Debug.LogWarning($"Unknown event type: {eventData.type}");
                break;
        }
    }
```

- Live episodes remain a stretch goal.
