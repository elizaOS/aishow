## Framework 
- The 3D visualization framework uses **Unity** for rendering.
- Sithlords AI showrunner framework runs on **client-side JavaScript** in a web browser. https://hackmd.io/@smsithlord/Hk7NOUrmke
  - It sends **async calls** to handle:
    - **Scene loading:** Includes location, list of actors, and named spawn points.
      - The stage responds with a `loadSceneComplete` event once finished.
    - **Dialogue lines:** Specifies the actor speaking and their line.
      - A TTS system speaks the line and fires a `speakComplete` event after finishing.
      -  **ElevenLabs** for voices
