# Reward and Recognition Pipeline

## Issue Summary
Develop an automated reward and recognition system that incentivizes community participation, contribution, and engagement through token-based rewards, special access privileges, and public recognition integrated with AI News content.

## Problem Statement
Community engagement lacks systematic incentives and rewards for valuable contributions. Contributors work without recognition or compensation, leading to burnout and reduced long-term participation. We need a comprehensive reward system that motivates sustained engagement while creating value loops that benefit both contributors and the ecosystem.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated tracking and scoring of community contributions across platforms
- [ ] Token-based reward distribution system with transparent criteria
- [ ] Tiered recognition levels with increasing privileges and benefits
- [ ] Integration with community spotlight and content features
- [ ] Gamification elements that encourage sustained participation
- [ ] Anti-gaming mechanisms to ensure fair and meaningful rewards
- [ ] Multi-platform reward coordination and synchronization
