# Translation Pipeline System

## Issue Summary
Implement automated translation of episode scripts from English to Korean and Chinese using LLM services to enable international episode generation.

## Problem Statement
ElizaOS has significant Korean and Chinese communities, but all AI News content is currently English-only. Manual translation is not scalable for daily episode production, and we need an automated pipeline that maintains quality while enabling rapid localization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Translate episode JSON scripts from English to target languages
- [ ] Preserve episode structure (scenes, dialogue, actors, actions)
- [ ] Support Korean and Chinese translation
- [ ] Maintain dialogue timing and context appropriately
- [ ] Handle technical terminology and proper nouns correctly
- [ ] Output translated scripts in same JSON format as original

## Technical Requirements

### Translation Scope
Process the complete episode script while preserving:
- Scene structure and timing
- Actor assignments and actions  
- Location references
- Technical terminology (ElizaOS, GitHub, crypto terms)
- Proper nouns (names, projects, companies)

### Input/Output Format
**Input**: Standard ShowRunner episode JSON
**Output**: Translated episode JSON with same structure

### Language Support
- **Korean (ko)**: For Korean ElizaOS community
- **Chinese Simplified (zh-CN)**: For Chinese ElizaOS community
- **Extensible**: Architecture should support adding more languages

### Translation Quality
- Preserve technical accuracy
- Maintain conversational tone appropriate for each language
- Handle context-dependent translations
- Keep character personalities consistent across languages

## Implementation Approach

### LLM Integration
- Use OpenRouter/Claude for translation services
- Include context about the show, characters, and technical terms
- Implement quality checks and validation

### Translation Process
1. Extract dialogue content from episode JSON
2. Prepare translation context (show info, character descriptions)
3. Translate dialogue while preserving structure
4. Validate translation quality and technical accuracy
5. Reconstruct episode JSON with translated content

### Error Handling
- Retry failed translations with different prompts
- Validate translated JSON structure
- Log translation issues for review
- Fallback to original English if translation fails completely

## Dependencies
- LLM API access (OpenRouter/Claude)
- Episode completion from ShowRunner system
- Access to original episode JSON files

## Success Metrics
- 100% of episodes successfully translated
- Translated episodes maintain proper JSON structure
- Translation quality acceptable to native speakers
- Translation process completes within episode generation timeline

## Cultural Considerations
- Adapt content for cultural context when appropriate
- Handle concepts that may not translate directly
- Consider local communication styles and preferences
- Respect cultural sensitivities

## Nice to Have
- Translation quality scoring
- Human review workflow for sensitive content
- Terminology glossary management
- A/B testing for translation approaches
- Community feedback integration for translation quality
