# Milestone 3: "Content Hub"
*"Making Content Discoverable and Searchable"*

## Overview
Build a comprehensive content hub that showcases the AI News archive, explains the fascinating technology behind episode creation, and optimizes content discoverability for both search engines and community members.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Static website with searchable episode archive
- [ ] Enhanced "About" page showcasing the AI news creation process
- [ ] SEO-optimized content structure for discoverability
- [ ] Episode browsing with search and filter functionality
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design for all devices
- [ ] Integration with existing publishing pipeline

## Issues to Create
1. [static-website-architecture.md](./static-website-architecture.md) - Core website structure and hosting
2. [episode-archive-system.md](./episode-archive-system.md) - Searchable episode database and browsing
3. [process-showcase-page.md](./process-showcase-page.md) - "How AI News is Made" content
4. [seo-optimization.md](./seo-optimization.md) - Search engine optimization and discoverability
5. [content-integration.md](./content-integration.md) - Integration with publishing pipeline

## Strategic Context
With automated publishing creating a growing archive of content across multiple languages, we need a central hub where people can:
- **Discover past episodes** they might have missed
- **Search for specific topics** or segments
- **Understand the technology** behind AI News creation
- **Share specific episodes** easily with others
- **Explore the international versions** in different languages

### Content Hub as Marketing
The "how it's made" aspect is fascinating content in itself. The AI news creation process - from Discord/GitHub data collection through LLM script generation to Unity 3D rendering - showcases cutting-edge AI applications that will attract developers and AI enthusiasts.

### Community Value
- **New members** can catch up on past episodes
- **Researchers** can find specific technical discussions
- **Partners** can easily reference episodes featuring their projects
- **International users** can discover content in their language

## Dependencies
- Milestone 1 (Automation Foundation) for publishing pipeline integration
- Episode metadata and content from existing shows
- Hosting platform decision (GitHub Pages, Vercel, custom)
- Design/branding assets

## Timeline
Target completion: End of August 2025

## Why This Matters
Without discoverability, even the best content gets lost. A content hub transforms episodic content into a searchable knowledge base, increases SEO presence, and provides a professional showcase of the AI News ecosystem that can attract new community members and partners.
