# Automated Playlist Management System

## Issue Summary
Implement automated YouTube playlist creation and management to organize episodes by type, date, and content category.

## Problem Statement
With daily episode generation, manual playlist organization becomes unsustainable. Viewers need organized access to content, and international versions will require separate playlists.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create playlists programmatically using YouTube Data API v3
- [ ] Automatically add new episodes to appropriate playlists
- [ ] Support multiple playlist types (daily episodes, market news, interviews, international)
- [ ] Maintain playlist order and metadata
- [ ] Handle playlist creation if they don't exist

## Technical Requirements

### Playlist Structure
Based on planned content types:

```json
{
  "playlists": {
    "daily_episodes": {
      "title": "AI News Daily Episodes",
      "description": "Daily AI news covering ElizaOS updates, market analysis, and ecosystem developments",
      "privacy": "public",
      "auto_add": ["daily", "main_show"]
    },
    "market_analysis": {
      "title": "Market Analysis with Spartan & Pepo", 
      "description": "Daily market updates and crypto analysis segments",
      "privacy": "public",
      "auto_add": ["market", "stonks"]
    },
    "interviews": {
      "title": "Ecosystem Interviews",
      "description": "Interviews with partners, DAOs, and community members",
      "privacy": "public", 
      "auto_add": ["interview", "splitscreen"]
    },
    "korean_episodes": {
      "title": "AI 뉴스 한국어",
      "description": "Korean language episodes covering AI and blockchain news",
      "privacy": "public",
      "auto_add": ["korean", "translated"]
    },
    "chinese_episodes": {
      "title": "AI新闻中文版",
      "description": "Chinese language episodes covering AI and blockchain news", 
      "privacy": "public",
      "auto_add": ["chinese", "translated"]
    }
  }
}
```

### API Integration Points
- Playlist creation: `POST https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlists`
- Add to playlist: `POST https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlistItems`
- Update playlist: `PUT https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlists`
- List playlists: `GET https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlists`

### Auto-Assignment Logic
- Parse episode metadata to determine content type
- Match episode tags with playlist `auto_add` criteria
- Add episode to multiple playlists if applicable
- Maintain chronological order within playlists

## Implementation Notes
- Use [YouTube Playlist API Guide](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/implementation/playlists)
- Cache playlist IDs to avoid repeated API calls
- Handle playlist not found errors by creating new playlists
- Store playlist mappings in configuration file

## Dependencies
- YouTube Data API v3 credentials (same as upload system)
- Episode metadata with content type tags
- Video upload system (to get video IDs)

## Success Metrics
- 100% of episodes automatically added to correct playlists
- Zero manual playlist management needed
- Playlists maintain proper chronological order
- International episodes correctly separated by language

## Error Handling
- Playlist creation failures
- Video not found errors
- API quota exceeded
- Duplicate video detection

## Nice to Have
- Playlist thumbnail auto-generation
- Smart playlist recommendations based on content
- Playlist analytics integration
- Bulk playlist operations for historical episodes
