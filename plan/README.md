## Planning Structure

### 📋 **Milestone 1: "Automation Foundation"** 
*Priority: Critical - Solves 2-week publishing delay*

The foundation that enables everything else - automating the publishing pipeline from episode generation to cross-platform distribution.

**Issues to Create:**
1. **[YouTube Upload API](./milestone1/youtube-upload-api.md)** - Core automated video uploads
2. **[Playlist Management](./milestone1/playlist-management.md)** - Organized content discovery  
3. **[Cross-Platform Posting](./milestone1/cross-platform-posting.md)** - Discord/Twitter automation
4. **[Metadata Generation](./milestone1/metadata-generation.md)** - AI-powered titles/descriptions

**Success Criteria:** Episodes published within 1 hour of generation with zero manual intervention.

## Strategic Context

### The Big Picture Vision
We're building a **global AI-powered media ecosystem** that:
- **Bridges Information Gaps**: Connects Discord, GitHub, Twitter, forums into coherent content
- **Meets Audiences Where They Are**: Developers get GitHub updates, community gets Discord content, visual learners get 3D shows
- **Scales Globally**: Multi-language support for ElizaOS's international community
- **Strengthens Ecosystem**: Partner interviews and DAO showcases build relationships

### Why Start with Automation?
Without reliable publishing, all other improvements are meaningless. The 2-week gap between episode creation and YouTube availability breaks the news cycle and kills engagement. Milestone 1 directly solves this operational crisis.

### Data Flow Integration
Our planning leverages the existing [ai-news pipeline](https://github.com/m3-org/ai-news):

```
AI News Collection → ShowRunner Unity Generation → Automated Publishing
     ↓                      ↓                          ↓
Discord/GitHub/Twitter → 3D Episode Creation → YouTube/Discord/Twitter
                           ↓
                    Translation Pipeline
                           ↓
               Korean/Chinese Episode Generation
                           ↓
              International Playlist Management
```

Each milestone automates key steps: **M1** = Publishing Pipeline, **M2** = Global Expansion.

## Issue Creation Workflow

1. **Review** individual issue markdown files in this folder
2. **Refine** any details based on your technical preferences and constraints  
3. **Create** GitHub issues using the markdown content
4. **Link** issues to Milestone 1 in GitHub project management
5. **Track** progress and dependencies

## Implementation Flexibility

These issues focus on **problem statements and requirements** rather than prescriptive solutions. Development teams can choose their preferred:
- Tech stack and programming languages
- API integration approaches  
- Data structures and formats
- Error handling strategies

The goal is to automate the publishing pipeline - how you achieve that is up to you!

## Key Dependencies
- YouTube Data API v3 credentials and setup
- Discord webhook configuration  
- Twitter API v2 access
- Integration points with [ai-news data](https://m3-org.github.io/ai-news/)
- ShowRunner episode completion events
