# Milestone 1: "Automation Foundation"
*"From Manual to Machine - Building the Publishing Pipeline"*

## Overview
Automate the end-to-end publishing pipeline to solve the critical issue of manual video uploads. The last episode on YouTube is 2 weeks old, showing the urgent need for automation.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Episodes automatically uploaded to YouTube within 1 hour of generation
- [ ] Playlists automatically managed and organized  
- [ ] Cross-platform posting (Discord + Twitter) happens automatically
- [ ] YouTube metadata (titles, descriptions, tags) generated from episode content
- [ ] Zero manual intervention required for standard episode publishing

## Issues to Create
1. [youtube-upload-api.md](./youtube-upload-api.md) - Core YouTube Data API v3 integration
2. [playlist-management.md](./playlist-management.md) - Automated playlist organization  
3. [cross-platform-posting.md](./cross-platform-posting.md) - Discord webhook + Twitter API
4. [metadata-generation.md](./metadata-generation.md) - Auto-generate YouTube metadata from show content

## Dependencies
- YouTube Data API v3 credentials
- Discord webhook setup
- Twitter API access
- Integration with existing [ai-news pipeline](https://github.com/m3-org/ai-news)

## Timeline
Target completion: End of June 2025

## Why This Matters
This milestone directly addresses the biggest operational pain point - getting content published consistently. Without automation, the community misses updates and engagement drops. This foundation enables all future milestones.
