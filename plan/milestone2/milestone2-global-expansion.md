# Milestone 2: "Global Expansion"
*"Breaking Language Barriers - Reaching the World"*

## Overview
Expand AI News to serve the global ElizaOS community with Korean and Chinese language versions. This addresses the top community request and taps into ElizaOS's significant international audience.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Korean language episodes generated daily alongside English versions
- [ ] Chinese language episodes generated daily alongside English versions  
- [ ] International episodes uploaded to appropriate YouTube playlists
- [ ] Cultural adaptation for regional markets (local news sources, regional context)
- [ ] Alternative animation system (Hedra) operational for translated content

## Issues to Create
1. [translation-pipeline.md](./translation-pipeline.md) - LLM-based script translation system
2. [korean-episode-generation.md](./korean-episode-generation.md) - Korean TTS and episode creation
3. [chinese-episode-generation.md](./chinese-episode-generation.md) - Chinese TTS and episode creation  
4. [international-playlists.md](./international-playlists.md) - YouTube playlist management for multiple languages
5. [hedra-avatar-system.md](./hedra-avatar-system.md) - Alternative animated avatar system (Plan B)
6. [cultural-adaptation.md](./cultural-adaptation.md) - Regional news sources and context

## Strategic Context
ElizaOS has a massive audience in Asia, particularly China and Korea. By not serving these markets in their native languages, we're missing a huge opportunity for community engagement and ecosystem growth.

### Translation Approach
- **Primary**: Translate episode scripts + use localized TTS voices
- **Alternative**: Hedra integration for AI-generated animated avatars with translated audio

### Content Strategy
- Start with direct translations of existing episodes
- Gradually add region-specific content and news sources
- Maintain consistent daily publishing schedule across all languages

## Dependencies
- Milestone 1 (Automation Foundation) completion
- Translation service access (OpenRouter/Claude)
- TTS services with Korean/Chinese voice support
- YouTube playlist management system
- Optional: Hedra API integration

## Timeline
Target completion: End of July 2025

## Why This Matters
International expansion directly serves ElizaOS's global community and could significantly increase engagement. The open source nature of ElizaOS makes it naturally appealing to international developers, and serving them in their native languages strengthens the entire ecosystem.
