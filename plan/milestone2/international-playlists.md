# International Playlist Management System

## Issue Summary
Implement automated playlist management for multiple language versions of AI News episodes to organize international content effectively.

## Problem Statement
With Korean and Chinese episodes being generated alongside English content, we need organized playlist management to help international audiences discover and follow content in their preferred languages. Manual playlist management becomes unsustainable with multiple daily episodes across languages.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create language-specific playlists automatically
- [ ] Add episodes to appropriate language playlists upon upload
- [ ] Maintain playlist organization and metadata in multiple languages
- [ ] Support playlist discovery for international audiences
- [ ] Handle playlist creation and management errors gracefully

## Technical Requirements

### Playlist Structure
Organize content by language and type:

**Language-Specific Playlists:**
- **Korean Playlists**:
  - "AI 뉴스 한국어" (AI News Korean) - Main Korean episodes
  - "시장 분석 한국어" (Market Analysis Korean) - Korean market content
  - "인터뷰 한국어" (Interviews Korean) - Korean interview content

- **Chinese Playlists**:
  - "AI新闻中文版" (AI News Chinese) - Main Chinese episodes  
  - "市场分析中文版" (Market Analysis Chinese) - Chinese market content
  - "访谈中文版" (Interviews Chinese) - Chinese interview content

### Playlist Management
- Auto-create playlists if they don't exist
- Add episodes to appropriate playlists based on language and content type
- Update playlist metadata and descriptions in target language
- Maintain consistent playlist ordering (chronological)

### Metadata Localization
- Playlist titles in target languages
- Descriptions explaining content in target languages  
- Appropriate tags for discoverability in each market
- Consistent branding across languages

## Implementation Approach

### Integration with Upload System
- Extend existing playlist management from Milestone 1
- Detect episode language from metadata or filename
- Route episodes to appropriate language-specific playlists
- Handle multiple playlist assignments per episode

### Playlist Creation Logic
- Check for existing language playlists on startup
- Create missing playlists with localized metadata
- Cache playlist IDs to avoid repeated API calls
- Update playlist descriptions and thumbnails as needed

### Content Type Detection
Determine appropriate playlists based on episode content:
- **Daily episodes**: Main language playlist
- **Market content**: Market analysis playlist for that language
- **Interview content**: Interview playlist for that language
- **Special content**: Appropriate specialized playlist

## Dependencies
- YouTube Data API v3 access (from Milestone 1)
- Episode upload automation system
- Korean and Chinese episode generation systems
- Translated metadata generation

## Success Metrics
- 100% of international episodes automatically added to correct playlists
- Playlists maintain proper organization and chronological order
- Zero manual playlist management required
- International audience can easily discover content in their language
- Playlist metadata correctly localized

## Playlist Discovery Optimization
- Use appropriate keywords for each language market
- Optimize playlist thumbnails for international appeal
- Consider regional YouTube algorithm preferences
- Implement consistent playlist branding across languages

## Error Handling
- Handle playlist creation failures gracefully
- Retry failed playlist assignments
- Log playlist management issues for review
- Fallback to manual assignment if automation fails
- Validate playlist IDs before attempting operations

## Cultural Considerations
- Respect cultural preferences for content organization
- Consider regional viewing patterns and preferences
- Adapt playlist descriptions for cultural context
- Use culturally appropriate playlist thumbnail styles

## Technical Challenges
- Character encoding for international playlist metadata
- Regional YouTube API differences or restrictions
- Playlist limits and quota management across multiple languages
- Consistent branding while respecting cultural preferences

## Nice to Have
- Playlist analytics by language
