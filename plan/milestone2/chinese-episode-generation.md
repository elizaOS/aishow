# Chinese Episode Generation System

## Issue Summary
Implement Chinese (Simplified) language episode generation using translated scripts and Chinese TTS voices to serve the Chinese ElizaOS community.

## Problem Statement
China represents one of the largest potential markets for ElizaOS, but language barriers prevent effective community engagement. We need to generate Chinese-language episodes using translated scripts and appropriate Chinese TTS voices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Generate Chinese audio from translated episode scripts
- [ ] Use appropriate Chinese TTS voices for each character
- [ ] Integrate with existing ShowRunner video generation system
- [ ] Maintain episode timing and pacing appropriate for Chinese language
- [ ] Generate Chinese episode videos with proper lip sync
- [ ] Output episodes with Chinese metadata and descriptions

## Technical Requirements

### TTS Integration
- Support for high-quality Chinese (Simplified) TTS voices
- Character voice mapping (assign specific Chinese voices to Marc, Eliza, Shaw, etc.)
- Proper pronunciation of technical terms and names
- Natural speech rhythm and intonation for Mandarin Chinese

### Character Voice Mapping
Map existing characters to appropriate Chinese voices:
- **Marc**: Male Chinese voice with confident, business-like tone
- **Eliza**: Female Chinese voice with friendly, tech-savvy tone  
- **Shaw**: Male Chinese voice with technical/developer tone
- **Spartan**: Male Chinese voice with energetic, trading-focused tone
- **Pepo**: Male Chinese voice with casual, cool tone

### Episode Generation Workflow
1. Receive translated Chinese episode JSON
2. Generate Chinese TTS audio for each dialogue line
3. Process through existing ShowRunner video generation
4. Generate Chinese metadata (title, description, tags)
5. Output Chinese episode video file

### Metadata Localization
- Translate episode titles to Chinese
- Generate Chinese descriptions with relevant context
- Use Chinese tags for better discoverability on Chinese platforms
- Maintain consistent branding in Chinese

## Implementation Approach

### TTS Service Options
Evaluate and integrate Chinese TTS services:
- Cloud TTS providers with Mandarin Chinese support
- Consider regional Chinese TTS providers for better quality
- Voice quality and naturalness assessment for Chinese audience

### ShowRunner Integration

- Adapt timing calculations for Chinese speech patterns
- Ensure lip sync compatibility with Chinese audio
- Maintain visual consistency with English episodes

### Quality Assurance
- Test Chinese pronunciation of technical terms (AI, blockchain, crypto)
- Validate episode timing and pacing for Chinese speech
- Ensure character voice consistency
- Review cultural appropriateness for Chinese audience

## Dependencies
