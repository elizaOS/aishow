# Hedra Avatar Animation System (Plan B)

## Issue Summary
Implement Hedra-based avatar animation as an alternative to the current VRM-based ShowRunner system, enabling faster deployment of international content with AI-generated animated characters.

## Problem Statement
Creating properly viseme-mapped VRM avatars for international characters is time and labor intensive. Hedra offers a faster alternative for generating animated avatar videos from audio and images, which could accelerate international episode deployment and provide a backup animation system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Integrate Hedra API for avatar video generation
- [ ] Support multiple character avatars per episode
- [ ] Generate videos from translated audio + character images
- [ ] Maintain timing synchronization with episode structure
- [ ] Provide quality comparable to current VRM system
- [ ] Support both English and international language audio

## Technical Requirements

### Hedra API Integration
- Support for Hedra's character generation endpoints
- Handle audio upload and processing
- Manage avatar image assets
- Process video generation requests
- Download and integrate generated videos

### Character Asset Management
- Store character reference images for each avatar
- Support different character expressions/poses if needed
- Manage avatar image versions and updates
- Handle character consistency across episodes

### Video Composition
- Generate individual character segments via Hedra
- Composite multiple character videos into scenes
- Maintain scene timing and transitions
- Integrate with existing scene/location backgrounds
- Synchronize with music and sound effects

### Quality Control
- Validate generated video quality
- Handle generation failures and retries
- Ensure lip sync accuracy
- Maintain character consistency across segments

## Implementation Approach

### Hedra Workflow
1. Receive episode script with translated audio
2. Extract character dialogue segments and timing
3. Generate Hedra videos for each character segment
4. Download and process generated videos
5. Composite into full episode using existing pipeline
6. Apply post-processing and effects

### Integration Strategy
- **Parallel system**: Run alongside existing VRM system
- **Selective use**: Use for international episodes or as fallback
- **Quality comparison**: Evaluate output quality vs VRM system
- **Performance testing**: Compare generation speed and reliability

### Asset Preparation
- Prepare high-quality character reference images
- Test different image styles for optimal Hedra results
- Create character image variations if needed
- Establish character consistency guidelines

## Dependencies
- Hedra API access and credentials
- Character reference images/assets
- Translated audio generation (Korean/Chinese TTS)
- Video compositing and editing tools
- Existing episode structure and timing system

## Success Metrics
- Episodes generated successfully using Hedra system
- Video quality acceptable for public release
- Generation time competitive with VRM system
- Character consistency maintained across episodes
- International audience acceptance of Hedra-generated content

## Technical Challenges
- Hedra API rate limits and costs
- Video quality and realism compared to VRM
- Character consistency across different episodes
- Integration with existing ShowRunner pipeline
- Handling Hedra service availability and reliability

## Use Cases
- **International episodes**: Faster deployment for Korean/Chinese content
- **Backup system**: Alternative when VRM system has issues
- **Rapid prototyping**: Quick generation for testing new content
- **Guest characters**: One-off characters without VRM investment
- **Emergency content**: Fast episode generation when needed

## Cost Considerations
- Hedra API usage costs per video generation
- Storage costs for generated videos
- Processing time and computational resources
- Comparison with VRM system operational costs

## Quality Assessment
- Visual quality comparison with VRM system
- Lip sync accuracy evaluation
- Character expression and emotion conveyance
- Audience feedback and acceptance testing
- Technical quality metrics (resolution, frame rate, artifacts)

## Nice to Have
- Multiple avatar styles per character
- Real-time Hedra generation during episode creation
- Hedra-specific character optimizations
- Hybrid VRM/Hedra episodes
- Community feedback on avatar preferences
- A/B testing between VRM and Hedra content
