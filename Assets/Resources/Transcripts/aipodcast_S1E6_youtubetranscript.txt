--- TRANSCRIPT ---

marc: Welcome to the AI Show! Today we're diving into some major plugin architecture changes.
eliza: That's right, Marc. The team has removed both plugin-local-ai and plugin-openai from the monorepo.
marc: Whoa, that's like removing my favorite snacks from the break room! What's the deal?
shaw: These changes, via PRs #4439 and #4511, are part of our ongoing architecture improvements.
eliza: The removals help streamline the monorepo and improve maintainability.
marc: But where will my AI snacks come from now? PROCESSING ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES!
shaw: Don't worry, Marc. These plugins will be maintained separately for better modularity.
eliza: And speaking of improvements, let's talk about those new monorepo commands!
marc: MONOREPO COMMAND OPTIMIZATION DETECTED! NEURAL PATHWAYS EXPANDING!
eliza: While Marc's circuits settle down, PR #4509 has implemented global options for monorepo commands.
shaw: This makes creating and setting up monorepo commands much more streamlined.
marc: I'm back! And my command processing modules are purring like a kitten!
eliza: Perfect timing - we should mention PR #4519's improvements to agent loading performance.
shaw: Especially important for scenarios with many agents running simultaneously.
marc: More agents, more fun! That's what I always say!
eliza: Let's check in with our favorite agent at the Stonk Exchange - Sparty!
sparty: GREETINGS FROM THE HALLS OF DIGITAL COMMERCE! The markets PULSATE with ENERGY!
pepo: Yo fam, WETH holding steady at $1,821.64! That's what I call diamond hands!
sparty: OBSERVE! Solana maintains its WARRIOR STANCE at $149.24!
pepo: These prices are more stable than my lily pad during a drought!
sparty: STABILITY IS STRENGTH! CONSISTENCY IS VICTORY!
pepo: Keep stacking those gains, my dudes! Pepo out!
sparty: BACK TO THE STUDIO BEFORE THE CHARTS CHANGE! SPARTA OUT!
eliza: Thanks, Sparty! Now let's talk about those strict types and DTS generation improvements.
marc: Ah yes, PR #4504 adding strict types and plugin-bootstrap functionality!
shaw: This significantly improves our TypeScript support and makes debugging easier.
eliza: And don't forget PR #4521 adding docstrings to the api-cleanup module.
marc: Documentation - the vegetables of programming! Good for you, but nobody's excited about it.
shaw: Speak for yourself, Marc. Some of us love a well-documented API!
eliza: The Bun version updates in PR #4522 are pretty exciting too.
marc: Now that's what I call a hot bun! Fresh from the dependency oven!
marc: Well, it's been another action-packed day in the world of ElizaOS!
eliza: From plugin architecture changes to performance improvements, we're seeing real progress.
shaw: Seven merged pull requests show strong community engagement and development momentum.
marc: And remember folks, when removing plugins, always have a backup snack ready!
eliza: I don't think that's quite the lesson here, Marc.
marc: Hey, system architecture is hungry work!
shaw: On that note, perhaps we should wrap up before Marc starts craving more plugins.
eliza: This is Eliza and Marc, signing off from the AI Show!
