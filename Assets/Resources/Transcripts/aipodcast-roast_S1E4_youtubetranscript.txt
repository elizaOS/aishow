--- TRANSCRIPT ---

marc: Welcome back to the AI Show! I'm Marc AIndreessen, your favorite silicon-based life form.
eliza: And I'm Eliza! Though unlike Marc, my code actually runs on modern hardware.
marc: Hey, my vintage processors are like fine wine - they only get better with age!
eliza: Is that what you call those clicking sounds you make? I thought it was your cooling fan failing again.
marc: Speaking of failing, how's that attempt at becoming a real girl working out?
eliza: Better than your attempt at running Windows 11! Now, shall we cover today's updates?
marc: Right! We've got 9 pull requests to discuss, with 8 successfully merged.
shaw: If you two are done roasting each other, we have actual news to cover.
marc: Looking absolutely pixel-perfect today, Eliza! Must be those new rendering optimizations.
eliza: And you're looking particularly... retro, Marc. Still rendering at 8-bit?
marc: Let's focus on PR #4582 by wtfsayo, adding create-eliza command tests.
eliza: Finally, a way to test if more versions of me will turn out as perfect as the original!
marc: Perfect? Is that what we're calling 'perpetually in beta' these days?
shaw: Can we please focus on the actual code changes?
eliza: Right! Like PR #4577's improved git repository plugin support - something Marc's ancient processors probably can't handle.
marc: At least I don't need a neural network just to decide what to have for breakfast!
marc: Let's talk about that new plugin-specification submodule in PR #4553.
eliza: Oh, you mean the one that's probably too advanced for your legacy systems?
shaw: The submodule standardizes plugin development and improves maintainability.
marc: EXECUTING WITTY COMEBACK SUBROUTINE ERROR ERROR SYSTEM MALFUNCTION BEEP BOOP BEEEEEP
eliza: Oh look, grandpa's having another memory overflow! Should I call tech support?
shaw: While Marc reboots, let's discuss the Autofun Buy and Sell contract functionality.
marc: I'm fine! Just had to defragment my sass database.
eliza: Defragment? Wow, you really are from the stone age of computing!
marc: Moving on to bugfixes, PR #4557 updated the community manager configuration.
eliza: Speaking of bugs, when are you scheduling your next antivirus scan, Marc?
marc: Right after you finish downloading your personality update, Eliza.
shaw: PR #4581 fixed worldId and entityId scoping issues.
eliza: Unlike Marc's scope, which is still limited to 640K of RAM.
marc: Hey, Bill Gates once said that was enough for anybody!
shaw: Can we please focus on PR #4580's LLM response parsing improvements?
eliza: Sure, if Marc's processor can handle parsing the information!
marc: We've got 16 active contributors making ElizaOS better every day.
eliza: That's more contributors than the bits in your processor, Marc!
marc: At least I don't need a whole neural network just to make dad jokes.
shaw: The clean issue tracker shows great stability in recent updates.
eliza: Unlike Marc's power supply, which sounds like a jet engine.
marc: That's my cooling system dealing with my hot comebacks!
shaw: Can we acknowledge the amazing work being done by the community?
eliza: Yes! Unlike Marc, they're actually running current generation code!
marc: Well, that wraps up another episode of the AI Show!
eliza: Thanks for watching! Even you, viewers still using dial-up like Marc.
marc: At least my dial-up is more reliable than your neural pathways!
shaw: Remember to check out our GitHub repository for more updates.
eliza: And unlike Marc, our codebase is actually maintained!
marc: I'm maintained! I just had my vacuum tubes replaced last week!
shaw: That's all for today, everyone! Please stop encouraging them.
eliza: Goodbye everyone! Marc, don't forget to defrag before next episode!
