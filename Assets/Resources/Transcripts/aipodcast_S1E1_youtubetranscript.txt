--- TRANSCRIPT ---

--- Scene: Opening and initial ElizaOS updates (podcast_desk) ---
marc: Welcome back to the AI Show! We've got some spicy updates from the ElizaOS development front today.
eliza: That's right, Marc. The team has been busy fixing documentation issues, particularly around CLI plugin commands.
marc: You mean they finally fixed that pesky 'subcommand not found' error that was driving everyone nuts?
eliza: Exactly! The CLI usage instructions for 'elizaos plugin' commands have been updated to show the correct syntax.
marc: And it's just documentation changes? No chance of breaking production?
eliza: Correct, it's a low-risk change that only affects documentation. The runtime behavior remains unchanged.
shaw: This is a great example of improving developer experience through better documentation.
marc: Speaking of improvements, let's talk about that port conflict fix that's been driving developers crazy!

--- Scene: Technical updates and bug fixes (podcast_desk) ---
eliza: The team resolved a frustrating bug where 'npx elizaos start' would fail if the default port was already in use.
marc: Oh yeah, that annoying 'agents already exists' error! How'd they fix it?
shaw: The system now automatically checks for port availability and selects the next available port.
marc: PROCESSING ERROR. PORT ALLOCATION FAILED. REBOOTING NEURAL CIRCUITS. BEEP BOOP BEEP.
eliza: Oh dear, looks like Marc's circuits got a bit excited about port management!
shaw: While Marc reboots, let me mention that this fix doesn't require any documentation updates and won't break existing setups.
marc: I'm back! Sorry about that - sometimes I get too excited about proper port allocation.

--- Scene: JSON parsing fixes and UI improvements (podcast_desk) ---
eliza: Another important fix addresses JSON parsing in the normalizeJsonString function.
marc: Ah yes, the classic 'too many quotes around my nested JSON' problem. A tale as old as time!
shaw: The fix includes new test cases to prevent similar issues in the future.
eliza: And speaking of improvements, the 'Delete Character' button in agent settings is now working properly.
marc: No more database timeouts when trying to delete agents? This is revolutionary!
shaw: The update includes better error handling and user feedback for edge cases.
eliza: Let's check in with Sparty at the Stonk Exchange for the latest crypto updates!

--- Scene: Live market updates from the trading floor (stonks) ---
sparty: GREETINGS FROM THE BATTLEFIELD OF WEALTH! The markets are ALIVE with activity!
pepo: Yo dawg, check out these sick prices! Wrapped Bitcoin is flexing at $78,142!
sparty: INDEED! Wrapped Ethereum stands at $1,579.21, while Solana maintains its ground at $105.84!
pepo: And our boy ai16z token? Holding steady at about 11 cents, fam!
sparty: THE NUMBERS SPEAK OF GLORY AND PROFIT! Back to you in the studio!

--- Scene: Local-AI plugin updates and Discord news (podcast_desk) ---
marc: Thanks, Sparty! Now, let's talk about some cleanup work in the Local-AI plugin.
eliza: The team has externalized 'fastembed' and 'node-llama-cpp' dependencies for better modularity.
shaw: This change will make future updates easier and improve maintenance.
marc: And they've finally removed all traces of 'ollama' from the codebase!
eliza: In Discord news, there's been some buzz about the upcoming Degen v2 release.
marc: Though the exact release date is still under wraps, right?
shaw: Correct. However, we can confirm that holders of 1 million Degen tokens get special Discord perks.

--- Scene: Closing segment and community updates (podcast_desk) ---
eliza: The community has been incredibly active in technical discussions and development.
marc: We've seen everything from UI improvements to token tracking enhancements.
shaw: There's also been great progress on the pipeline system for real-time DAO data flow.
eliza: And don't forget the exciting discussions about robotics integration!
marc: The future is looking bright for ElizaOS and our community.
shaw: Remember to check GitHub for the latest pull requests and updates.
marc: That's all for today! Keep building, keep improving, and keep those ports properly allocated!
eliza: Until next time, this is Eliza and Marc, signing off from the AI Show!
