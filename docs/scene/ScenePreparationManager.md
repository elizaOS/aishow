# ScenePreparationManager Component

## Overview
The ScenePreparationManager handles the preparation and loading of scenes in the show system. It coordinates scene loading with intro sequences and manages the transition between scenes.

## Dependencies
- IntroSequenceManager: For intro animations
- SceneManager: For scene loading
- Event System: For coordination

## Core Components

### References
```csharp
public IntroSequenceManager introSequenceManagerRef;
```
- Intro sequence manager reference
- Handles scene introductions

### Events
```csharp
public event Action<string> OnScenePrepareRequested;
public event Action<string> OnScenePreparationComplete;
```
- Scene preparation request
- Preparation completion notification

## Core Functionality

### Scene Preparation
```csharp
public void RequestScenePreparation(string sceneName)
public void HandlePrepareScene(string sceneName)
```
- Triggers scene preparation
- Handles scene loading
- Manages intro sequences
- Coordinates transitions

### Scene Loading
```csharp
private IEnumerator LoadSceneAsync(string sceneName)
```
- Asynchronous scene loading
- Progress tracking
- Scene activation
- Error handling

### Intro Sequence
```csharp
private IEnumerator PrepareSceneWithIntro(string sceneName, bool loadScene)
```
- Intro sequence playback
- Scene loading coordination
- Completion signaling
- State management

## Best Practices
1. Validate scene names
2. Handle loading errors
3. Coordinate with intro sequences
4. Manage scene transitions
5. Monitor loading progress

## Error Handling
- Validates scene existence
- Handles missing components
- Manages loading errors
- Provides fallbacks
- Logs important events

## Integration Points
- IntroSequenceManager: For intros
- SceneManager: For loading
- Event System: For coordination
- ShowRunner: For scene control
- Transition System: For effects

## Performance Considerations
- Asynchronous loading
- Memory management
- Progress tracking
- Scene activation
- Resource usage

## Setup Requirements
1. IntroSequenceManager reference
2. Scene build settings
3. Event system setup
4. Scene loading configuration
5. Intro sequence setup

## Debugging
- Scene loading progress
- Intro sequence timing
- Event handling
- Error tracking
- State management

## Event Handling
- Scene preparation requests
- Preparation completion
- Loading progress
- Intro sequence completion
- Scene activation

## Scene Loading Process
1. Request scene preparation
2. Play intro sequence
3. Load scene asynchronously
4. Track loading progress
5. Activate scene when ready
6. Signal completion

## State Management
- Scene loading state
- Intro sequence state
- Preparation state
- Transition state
- Error state

## Configuration
- Scene build settings
- Intro sequence setup
- Loading parameters
- Event subscriptions
- Error handling
