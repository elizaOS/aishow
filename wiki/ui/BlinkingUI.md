# BlinkingUI Component

## Overview
`BlinkingUI` is a MonoBehaviour for toggling the visibility of a RawImage component at a set interval, creating a blinking effect. It is useful for attention-grabbing UI elements, warnings, or notifications.

## Core Responsibilities
- Toggle the enabled state of a RawImage at a configurable interval.
- Allow enabling/disabling the blinking effect at runtime.
- Ensure the RawImage is visible when blinking is disabled.

## Main Features
- `blinkInterval`: Time in seconds between blinks.
- `isBlinking`: Toggle for enabling/disabling the effect.
- `SetBlinking(bool enabled)`: Public method to enable or disable blinking.

## How It Works
1. On Awake, gets the RawImage component.
2. In Update, toggles the RawImage's enabled state every `blinkInterval` seconds if blinking is enabled.
3. If blinking is disabled, ensures the RawImage remains visible.
4. Provides a public method to enable or disable blinking at runtime.

## Best Practices
- Attach to a GameObject with a RawImage component.
- Use for warning indicators, notifications, or attention-grabbing UI.
- Adjust `blinkInterval` for desired effect.

## Error Handling
- Logs an error if RawImage is missing.
- Ensures RawImage is visible when blinking is disabled.

## Integration Points
- UI: For blinking indicators or notifications.
- RawImage: For image-based UI elements.

## Example Usage
1. Attach to a GameObject with a RawImage.
2. Set the blink interval and enable/disable blinking as needed.
3. Call `SetBlinking(true/false)` to control the effect at runtime.
