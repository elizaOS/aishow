# ToggleBasedOnObjects Component

## Overview
`ToggleBasedOnObjects` is a MonoBehaviour for monitoring the active state of multiple GameObjects and controlling the volume of an AudioSource based on their activity. It is useful for context-sensitive audio or UI feedback.

## Core Responsibilities
- Monitor an array of GameObjects for their active state.
- Control the volume of an AudioSource on a target GameObject.
- Periodically check the state of monitored objects.

## Main Features
- `objectsToMonitor`: Array of GameObjects to check for activity.
- `checkInterval`: How often to check (in seconds).
- `controlledObject`: The GameObject whose AudioSource is controlled.
- Sets AudioSource volume to 0.4 if any monitored object is active, otherwise 0.

## How It Works
1. On Start, gets the AudioSource from the controlled object.
2. Starts a coroutine to check the monitored objects at regular intervals.
3. If any monitored object is active, sets the AudioSource volume to 0.4; otherwise, sets it to 0.

## Best Practices
- Assign all monitored objects and the controlled object in the Inspector.
- Use for context-sensitive audio cues or UI feedback.
- Adjust `checkInterval` for responsiveness vs. performance.

## Error Handling
- Logs an error if the controlled object lacks an AudioSource.
- Ignores null objects in the monitored array.

## Integration Points
- Audio: For context-sensitive sound effects.
- UI: For feedback based on object activity.

## Example Usage
1. Attach to a GameObject in your scene.
2. Assign objects to monitor and the controlled object in the Inspector.
3. The AudioSource volume will update automatically based on monitored object activity.
